Everything is working except test basic, which is somehow not getting to the bit where the longestRepeated variable is getting updated, and idk why. I'm definitely going to try running it with breakpoints tomorrow and get some help in class if that doesn't work. |
| October 11 | 10:55-11:55 | figured out what was going wrong, needed to increment my value of i after a STR is found so that I don't double count instances. everything works, and is pretty fast considering its the first try, but i'm going to try and represent the letters as numbers to speed up the runtime. I think it will work best to use binary for each of the letters (A = 00, C = 01, G = 10, T = 11) and use bit shifting to change the window of letters we're looking at. |
