| October 10 |  5:15-5:45  |   Kept working and fixed up the bit after iterating through the sequence. Everything is working except test basic, which is somehow not getting to the bit where the longestRepeated variable is getting updated, and idk why. I'm definitely going to try running it with breakpoints tomorrow and get some help in class if that doesn't work. |
