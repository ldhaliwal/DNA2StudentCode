| October 9  | 12:30 -1:15  pm |                                                                                                                                                                                     brainstormed how to solve, came up with an idea to iterate through the sequence once and save each instance of the STR to look through later. wrote out the beginning of the code and ran it, surprisingly worked on 3/5?? i think i know what I need to do to fix it more. |
| October 10 |  5:15-5:45  pm  |                                                                                                                  Kept working and fixed up the bit after iterating through the sequence. Everything is working except test basic, which is somehow not getting to the bit where the longestRepeated variable is getting updated, and idk why. I'm definitely going to try running it with breakpoints tomorrow and get some help in class if that doesn't work. |
| October 11 |  10:55-11:55am  | figured out what was going wrong, needed to increment my value of i after a STR is found so that I don't double count instances. everything works, and is pretty fast considering its the first try, but i'm going to try and represent the letters as numbers to speed up the runtime. I think it will work best to use binary for each of the letters (A = 00, C = 01, G = 10, T = 11) and use bit shifting to change the window of letters we're looking at. |

I think its an issue with how im doing the shifting thing after each letter to update currentBinary, and I don't totally understand what i'm doing in the first place so that could be why. |

| October 21 |    9-9:30pm     |                                                          started to write the recursive method, also tried to write the hash method. I'm confused about declaring global variables, a bit embarrassing that I forgot that but oh well, will figure it out in class tomorrow. I'm trying to minimize the number of things i have to pass into each of my other methods (especially the recursive one), so i'm trying to make as many of them global as possible. |
